        <h3>Explore together</h3>
        <p><i class="fas fa-globe-europe"></i></p>
        <p>
          Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to
          making science accessible to all.
        </p>

        <p>
          The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
          experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a
          lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought
          to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different
          exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of
          these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around
          to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they
          only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).
        </p>

        <h3>Get involved</h3>
        <h4>Support</h4>
        <p>
          There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very
          welcome and are an important way we keep this museum open and
          accessible to the whole community.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum’s
          collections. If you have some item or collection that you think others
          would enjoy, please let us know by contacting our Collections
          Department and they will be able to assist you.
        </p>
        <h4>Volunteer</h4>
        <p>
          A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
          displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
          Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes
          of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly
          lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas
          for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please
          contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get
          involved.
        </p>
        <h4>Internships</h4>
        <p>
          Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun and
          excitement of sharing the wonders of nature with people? Well you
          could be just the right person to enjoy an internship at the museum.
        </p>
        <p>
          You’ll be learning from a number of different academics and people who
          are passionate about science and sharing it with the wider community.
